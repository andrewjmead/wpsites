# WPSites

WPSites is a command line tool for creating and managing localhost WordPress sites.

I built this tool to automate a lot of the things I'd end up doing as a full-time WordPress plugin developer. If you're building a WordPress plugin (or theme!), I think you'll get a lot of value out of this tool.

First, make sure that you have [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) installed. From there you can install WPSite by running:

```

```
