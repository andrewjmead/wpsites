# WPSites

WPSites is a command line tool for creating and managing localhost WordPress sites.

I built this tool to automate a lot of the things I'd end up doing as a full-time WordPress plugin developer. If you're building a WordPress plugin (or theme!), I think you'll get a lot of value out of this tool.

WPSites ships with a copy of the WordPress CLI. 

Install it using composer:

```
composer global require andrewmead/wpsites
```
